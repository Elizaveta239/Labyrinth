This program finds the shortest path in labyrinth between two points.
Labyrinth and points are sutiated in unput file. Input file format:
width of labyrinth(integer > 0)
height of labyrinth(integer > 0)
coordinates of start(two integer separated by space)
coordinates of finish(two integer separated by space)
labyrinth (h lines, each w characters. Characters are 0 and 1. 1 means wall, 0 means empty space).

Coordinates for start and finish points are:
 ---> X
|
|
V
Y

So, 
1 1 -- coordinates of the left top point
w h -- coordinates of the right bottom point
w 1 -- coordinates of the right top point
1 h -- coordinates of the left bottom point

Examples of input files are in directory 'input'.

Program finds the length of shortest path and the shortest path and shows it. Or says that it doesn't exist.
